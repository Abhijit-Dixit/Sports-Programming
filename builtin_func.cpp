ceil is SIF smallest integer greater than given float;
ceil(a/b)=(a+b-1)/b;
rounding down
floor is GIF greatest integer smaller than given float;
floor(a/b)=ceil(a/b)-1=((a+b-1)/b)-1;



lower_bound points to first element greater than or equal to val.
upper_bound points to first element greater than val
usage
lower = lower_bound (v.begin(), v.end(), val);  
upper = upper_bound (v.begin(), v.end(), val);

s1=string in which replacement has to be made;
s2=string that replaces;
start=index where replacement would began;
span=how many indexes it would cover;

// when multipying two long numbers such that the result can be of longlong type then making the LHS equal to long long wouldn't be enough
// individual operands on RHS should also be made long long

// if there is no chance of working with negatives then you should use unsigned for extra range...

//if question used one based indexing then you too, use one based indexing to avoid confusion.
